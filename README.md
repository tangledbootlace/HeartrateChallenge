# Heartrate Challenge

ASP.Net Web Application hosted at https://heartratechallenge.azurewebsites.net/.

This application is used to facilitate a month-long fitness competition.

Participants record their heart rate during a workout by wearing a Polar H10 heart rate monitor. They then export their workout information as .csv and then upload a .zip file to the Heartrate Challenge website in order to calculate points for spending time in established heart rate zones.
