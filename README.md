# Heartrate Challenge

ASP.Net Web Application hosted at https://heartratechallenge.azurewebsites.net/.

This application is used to facilitate a month-long fitness competition.

Participants record their heart rate during a workout by wearing a Polar H10 heart rate monitor. They then export their workout information as .csv and then upload a .zip file to the Heartrate Challenge website in order to calculate points for spending time in established heart rate zones.

<h2>Heart Rate Zones</h2>

Zones are based on the participant's maximum heart rate.<br>
90%-100%: 9 points per minute<br>
80%-89.9%: 7 points per minute<br>
70%-79%: 5 points per minute<br>
60%-69.9%: 3 points per minute<br>
50%-59.9%: 1 point per minute<br>
